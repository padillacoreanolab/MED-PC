\Counter and Flag array

\C(0) counter for number of port entries
\C(1) counter for CS presentation number
\C(2) counter for US delivery : this is 1-indexed,  meaning number indicates number of sucrose deliveries
\C(3) flag to indicate if sucrose is in port =0 if no port entry was made, =1 if port entry was made (i.e., no sucrose)
\C(4) counter for number of port exits
\C(5) number of CS1

\C(7) number of CS3
\C(8) number of sucrose deliveries
\C(9) number of shock deliveries
